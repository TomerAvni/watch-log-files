Yes. When you open your project up for pitches, the community will be able to see it and you can choose from among those videographers who pitch to you.  
You can also peruse videographer profiles and portfolios and when you find someone you really like, you can invite that person to your project.  
If you choose the option to allow Veed.me to choose, we will match you with a trusted and talented professional.
Our creators use their own camera equipment and tools, or they will rent from other companies as necessary. In terms of editing and effects, they will use the most up to date versions of industry standard programs like Final Cut Pro, Premiere, Avid, etc.
